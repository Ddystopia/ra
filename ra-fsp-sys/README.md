# RA-FSP-SYS

This is a basic wrapper over Flexible Software Package, a bare minimum to correctly compile and run basic Rust program.

This crate should be used *instead* of `cortex-m-rt`, but it makes a best effort to mimic it's interface. This way, you can use Embassy and RTIC wihout any problems.

## Runtime

- Applies a manufacturerâ€‘provided linker script to support features like ID code protection.
- Basic vector table is provided by FSP, including `Reset_Handler`, which will call `SystemInit` (to configure C runtime, clocks etc) and then `main`.
- Application specific vector table may be provided by the user using `.application_vectors` section. Associated PACs do provide it.

### What you must provide

- `FSP_CFG` env variable with header files to configure FSP.
  - Contains all `r_.*_cfg.h` coniguration files.
  - Containst `/bsp` directory witb bsp configurations, like `bsp_cfg.h`, `board_cfg.h`, `bsp_clock_cfg.h` etc.
- `memory.x`.
- `device.x` provided by [PAC](https://github.com/Ddystopia/ra).
- Add `-C link-arg=-Tra-fsp-sys.x` (as `-Tlink.x` with `cortex-m-rt`).
- `FSP_OVERWRITE` env variable provides the source code for FSP.
- `CMSIS_OVERWRITE` env variable provides the source code for CMSIS.
